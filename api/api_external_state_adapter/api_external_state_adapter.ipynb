    "BPTK-Py offers a way to persist data externally. This allows simulation instances to be fully restored from a save point - one example of how we use this in practice is to persist the current state of a [Beer Distribution Game](https://beergame.transentis.com) session to an external database. This ensures that a game can be resumed in the case of a system failure."

    "To persist state, an instantiation of a class inheriting `BPTK_Py.ExternalStateAdapter` must be passed into the BPTK-server constructor. When an adapter is provided, BPTK will call the corresponding methods in the provided `ExternalStateAdapter` implementation automatically. \n",
