# DataCollector

DataCollectors are used to collect data generated by Agents during an agent based simulation. The default data collector collects the value of each Agent property at every timestep - but you can create your own datacollects.

See the [Custom Data Collectors](/abm/custom_datacollectors/custom_datacollectors.ipynb) page for details.

## DataCollector Collector

**DataCollector()**

A datacollector for the agent based simulation.

Collects the output data of each agent/event and makes it available to external resources such as BPTK-Py to plot the data
## DataCollector.collect_agent_statistics

**collect_agent_statistics(time, agents)**

Collect agent statistics from agent(s).


* **Parameters**

    * **time** – Timestep. The timestep at which to collect agents.

    * **agents** – List of agent. The list of agents to collect.

## DataCollector.record_event

**record_event(time, event)**

Record an event.


* **Parameters**

    
    * **time** – Timestep.
    The time at which to record the event.


    * **event** – event instance
